Excellent!

By the way, there are two caveats to this operation...
    [1] The number of attempts that the device will allow you
        to make decreases as the difficulty of the lock
        increases.
    [2] The compound is heavily guarded by enemy forces. We
        will disable their security cameras, but that still
        leaves you with only ~5 minutes before your
        situation becomes... untenable.

Failing to break the lock in the allotted number of attempts
or the allotted time will result in triggering the alarm, and
very likely your capture.
