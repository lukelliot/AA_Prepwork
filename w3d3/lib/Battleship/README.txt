Hey AppAcademy

So I read the battleship.md page, but then almost completely ignored the rspec's
this time. I don't think any of them will pass because all of my variables are named
different things. I have tested the game, though.

It has the:
if __FILE__ = $0
  Battleship.new.play
end

in the file, so it's best to start the game by just running it from the console/folder
with:

ruby 'battleship.rb'


One more thing! it is set up to use the Arrow keys. There are menus that looks like this:

________________________
    this   |  [ that ]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As well as other selection screens, I didn't make a text prompt to tell you to use
the Arrows for some, because it looked cleaner this way. I was hoping it would be
self explanatory, but if not, this is the notice.
